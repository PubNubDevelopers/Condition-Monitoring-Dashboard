# Condition-Monitoring-Dashboard
This demo shows how you can build a industrial quality Condition Monitoring Dashboard. 

Please see the gh-pages branch for the dashboard files. The main branch contains the firmware for the programmable logic controller that streams the vibration data using PubNub to the condition moinitoring dashboard.

Data is collected using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) connected to vibration sensors. The PLC reports the X and Y values from the vibration sensors that indicate how much the monitored equipment is moving. Since this is real data, the dashboard will show various states as the equipment operates. 
Vibration and other condition sensors can be used to make informed maintenance decisions and predict when maintenance will be needed to avoid downtime. 
This demo shows how PubNub can be used to transmit sensor values in real time. This demo is entirely powered by PubNub and can be expanded with more data and other PubNub features. For more industrial or IoT use cases and strategies, such as dashboards similar to this one, our solution architect and support teams can help.

Features:
- Actual sensor data streaming over PubNub
- Created using industrial-quality hardware and sensors
- Visualize vibration data
- Indicators to show when abnormal vibrations exist
- Indicators to show when dangerous conditions exist
